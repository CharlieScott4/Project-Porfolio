      <p3>Disclaimer:Videos were made when I was younger<p3>
        <p4>Some of these videos show how my skill progressed over the years when it comes to film making and video editing. I learned most of my skills from youtube and practice but I did have some help from a few of my classes. During 2020-2021 I took a video editing class which taught me a bit about adobe premier and photoshop, although I currently use Wondershare Filmora 9 to edit I plan on switching over to something a little more complex soon. The video editing class was run by my teacher Ms. Mcdonald who is know teaching my coding class. These classes are both giving more experience and adding to my knowledge. A little tip for those getting started is to just practice around in your editing software and look up tutorials on youtube. Those are just a few ways I learned some of my video editing skills and I plan on expanding my knowledge!</p4>
